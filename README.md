# Java Packet Routing Simulation

## Aim

To Demonstrate the routing of packets from a source machine to a destination machine using appropriate routing algorithms.

## Introduction

The routing algorithm is that part of the network layer responsible for deciding to which path an incoming packet should be transmitted on to.
In most of the cases, packets are supposed to pass through many different intermediate nodes to reach the destination.
The algorithms that choose the routes and the data structures that they use are a major area of network layer design.

## Goal

So, the sole aim of this application is to demomstrate the user how this routing of packets takes place under different circumstances.
The routing algorithms being used are

1. Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path through a graph.

## Future Enhancements
To add more algorithms.

## Requirements

javac 1.8.0_201 compiler (Should support applet viewer).
